# The-Taste-of-Success


**Introduction**

Welcome to "The Taste of Success Project," aimed at helping Danny's Diner leverage their customer data to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. As Danny is passionate about Japanese food and has opened his restaurant, Danny's Diner, we are here to assist him in utilizing the data to enhance customer experiences and make informed business decisions.

**Problem Statement**

Danny has gathered basic data from the initial months of his restaurant operation but needs assistance in analyzing the data to answer essential questions about customer visiting patterns, expenditure, and favorite menu items. The goal is to establish a deeper connection with customers, paving the way for a more personalized dining experience. Danny aims to use these insights to make decisions about expanding the customer loyalty program and requires basic datasets for easier data inspection by his team, without the need for SQL.
